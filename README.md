# Time-Series Forecasting for Energy Markets

Energy markets are fundamentally time-dependent: demand, renewable generation, weather, and price formation all evolve hour by hour (or quarter-hour by quarter-hour). In day-ahead power markets, decisions are made *before* realized prices are known, so forecast quality directly affects dispatch quality, trading outcomes, and risk exposure.

This is especially important for batteries and flexible portfolios, where each wrong forecast can consume limited cycle budget on suboptimal spreads.

## Motivation from external benchmark evidence

This work is motivated by the Re-Twin Energy article:

- **Article:** *Impact of Day-Ahead Forecast Accuracy on BESS Revenues*
- **URL:** https://re-twin.energy/blog/impact-of-day-ahead-forecast
- **Study setup (article):** Germany, 15-minute day-ahead prices, Jan–Mar 2026 backtest

### Financial impact figures reported in the article

For a representative **2h battery, 1.5 cycles/day**, the article reports:

| Signal | Revenue (EUR/MW) | Captured vs Perfect Foresight | Gap to Perfect Foresight (EUR/MW) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Previous-day baseline | 10,904 | 78.4% | 3,010 |
| Re-Twin forecast | 11,628 | 83.6% | 2,286 |
| Electricity Maps forecast | 12,163 | 87.4% | 1,751 |
| Perfect foresight | 13,914 | 100.0% | 0 |

The same article reports price-forecast MAE values:

- Previous-day baseline: **27.9 EUR/MWh**
- Re-Twin forecast: **21.4 EUR/MWh**
- Electricity Maps forecast: **17.2 EUR/MWh**

These numbers provide a practical business reason for this project: reducing forecasting error can materially increase realized value from the same physical energy asset.

## Project lineage

The original end-to-end data [platform](https://github.com/hasanerdin/zephyrwerk-platform/tree/main) and ML workflow was developed by **Hasan Erdin**. I adapted and extended this repository for focused **time-series forecasting and experimentation**, including rolling/expanding-window evaluation and comparative benchmarking.

## Metrics achieved in this repository

The table below summarizes the key forecasting results from the reports in `ml/artifacts` and compares each MAE against the article benchmark MAE.

> Data sources in this repo: `ml/artifacts/price_hourly_model_report.json`, `ml/artifacts/price_forecast_model_report.json`, `ml/artifacts/re_twin_study_price_benchmark_report.json`.

| Model / Evaluation | MAE (EUR/MWh) | Baseline MAE (EUR/MWh) | Training Window | Test / Holdout Window | MAE vs Article Electricity Maps (17.2) |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|
| Article benchmark: Electricity Maps forecast | 17.2 | 27.9 (prev-day) | n/a (external study) | 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31 | 0.000 |
| Article benchmark: Re-Twin forecast | 21.4 | 27.9 (prev-day) | n/a (external study) | 2026-01-01 to 2026-03-31 | +4.200 |
| Price hourly (2-stage weekly expanding, Stage 1 holdout aggregate) | 15.276 | 26.948 | Expanding from 2023-05-01 up to each forecast week start | 2026-01-01 to 2026-04-01 (exclusive) | -1.924 |
| Price quarter-hourly (2-stage weekly expanding, Stage 2 holdout aggregate) | **17.715** | 26.095 | Expanding from 2025-10-01 up to each forecast week start | 2026-01-01 to 2026-04-01 (exclusive) | **+0.515** (achieved best) |

<!-- | Price hourly (single-window holdout) | **16.178** | 26.863 | 2023-05-01 00:00 to 2025-12-31 23:00 | 2026-01-01 00:00 to 2026-03-31 23:00 | **-1.022** (better) | **-5.222** (better) |
 -->

## Interpretation

- The repository’s **hourly models** (both single-window and Stage 1 in 2-stage backtest) outperform the article’s published 17.2 EUR/MWh reference MAE.
- The **quarter-hour Stage 2 model** is slightly above 17.2 EUR/MWh, but still materially better than the article’s 21.4 EUR/MWh Re-Twin MAE and much better than previous-day baseline levels.
- Overall, the results support the same practical conclusion as the article: **forecast accuracy is economically meaningful**, not just statistically meaningful.

## Notes on comparability

- External and internal studies are not perfectly identical (data contract details, data omission, model classes, and holdout slicing most possibly differ).
- The article benchmark report stored in this repo explicitly preserves published MAE values and notes that additional metrics (RMSE, R², directional accuracy) were not provided in the source article.
- **Use MAE comparisons as directional performance context rather than strict like-for-like head-to-head claims.**
